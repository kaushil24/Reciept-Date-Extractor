Problem Statement: 
Build a RESTful service that extracts expense date from a receipt. Please feel free to use any language and framework of your choice. Deploy the service on any cloud platform like Heroku/AWS/GCP. The service should contain one API which has the following contract:

Request:
POST /extract_date

Payload:
{“base_64_image_content”: <base_64_image_content>}

Response:
If date is present:
{“date”: “YYYY-MM-DD”}
If date is not present:
{“date”: null}

Calculate the accuracy of the service against the sample receipts dataset given. This can be calculated as follows:

accuracy = (number of receipts for which the service extracted correct date/total receipts)*100%
